			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hi there!</h1>
			<p>
				This is the start of my Blog. I will be making updates to this blog in the coming weeks.
				Stay tuned for more content!
			</p>
			<p>
				The general idea is to hace a collection of articles that I can use as reference for my work and to showcase my skills.
				You can also use this blog as a reference for your own projects.
				Feel free to copy and paste any code you find useful.
			</p>
			<p>I will be covering things like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Programming Languages</li>
				<li>Software architecture</li>
				<li>Algorithms</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>
